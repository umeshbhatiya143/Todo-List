      <p>1st Example: Basic Routing
      In this example we have 3 “pages” 
      handled by the router: a home page,
       an about page, and a users page. As
        you click around on the different s, 
        the router renders the matching .Note: 
        Behind the scenes a  renders an  with a 
        real href, so people using the keyboard 
        for navigation or screen readers will still 
        be able to use this app.</p>
  </div>
  )
};
